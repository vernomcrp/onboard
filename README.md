# Security Policy

It's easy to get hacked. (Watch [Mr. Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/)).
Hackers use [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)) in order to obtain information about you.

If you want access to [Slack](https://slack.com)/[Github](https://github.com)/[Waffle.io](https://waffle.io)/Gmail/etc, you are required to have 50 character passwords and [2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication), when possible, including for your personal accounts.

 - Use the 1Password 'trial' (it doesn't seem to expire):

   - https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios
   - https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions
 - Gmail:
   - https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/
   - https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en
 - Facebook:
   - https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823

For every old website you go to, make a habit of changing your password generating a 50 character password for it, putting it into 1Password.

**Make sure to have an anti-virus for your Mac:** [Sophos Personal](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-antivirus-for-mac-home-edition.aspx)

All employees need access to Waffle.io for issue tracking.

# FAQ

### Why Meshable, when the product is called getWiFi?

Here is the history, we are a [mesh networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) company.

 - **September 2015**
   - Meshify - Mesh networking, but there is already a company called meshify
 - **December 2015**
   - Renamed to Mesh-able ; a device that can participate in a mesh network
 - **January 2016**
   - Bought getwi.fi domain
 - **February 2016**
   - renamed everything front facing to getWiFi because it makes a lot more sense
